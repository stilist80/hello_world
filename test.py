''' I still couid not find possibility to highlight syntax in the file. Honestly I am on the stage of "ten fingers" type in English 
learning and that text is typed without looking on the keyboard. I am pretty good in typing in Russain and think that saved month or even
years from 2005 then I used to be ill for a few days and never remember why but installed the program named babytype and finished it in 
couple of days. Next week working in office was very importand as I was making a lot of mistakes and as I remember wished to take a look
on the keyboard very much. But the thing is that it took not a lot of time to become better. As I remember just a first few days - 10-20
pages to finally confirm I could type as good and as fast as I could do it with looking on keyboard (I was already familiar with computers
and erned money setting up operating systems and environment so I was already enough fast - the same like most of other people using 
computers everyday) but the difference was in inner feeling. I removed "keyboard process" - it is something then you know where the each 
key is but before each press you somehow observe keyboard managing it nor the screen. It usually when you learn "life typing" withour any
system and then you could be good but as your fingers do not know where to be without general observing you have to spend time on it and 
you will always have to check it. One-two-three-four - now it is thirteen lines typed in this file and I am slowly begin to get letters 
faster then I remember where to move each of my fingers. That is the second or the third stage after you have finished any program which
brings you the system and lead you through the the process when new letters will appear on the screen after first "asdf" and "jkl;". From
line to line you type faster and still making mistakes you start automatically solving them also much faster. This speed comes not from
your thinking but from your fingers which just start type what you think of. It could be said you forgetting about fingers and from line
to line you feel they are just serving you.'''
